I really hope to be an artist when I grow up! Painting and drawing make me so happy. Lately, I've been excited and a bit nervous about my art classes. I feel happy when I create something beautiful, but sometimes I worry if I'm good enough.
My friendships make me super happy! My best friend, Lily, and I have so much fun together. But sometimes, I get sad if we argue. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions. Overall, my friends make me feel loved and understood, which is amazing!
I worry all the time, and it's like a storm inside my head. It makes me feel incredibly anxious, like butterflies are fluttering in my stomach, and I can't catch my breath. The worry gnaws at me, making me feel sad and scared. It's like a heavy cloud hanging over me, making everything seem daunting. I wish I could stop, but it's really hard. It bothers me so much that I feel like crying sometimes. Talking to my family helps, but the worry always creeps back in, and it feels overwhelming.
