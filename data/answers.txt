I'm just a kid, so I don't think too much about the future. But I guess it would be cool to be a scientist one day and discover new things. I also dream about traveling the world and seeing amazing places.
Lately, I've been feeling excited about learning new things in school, but sometimes it's also a bit overwhelming. I feel happy when I do well in my tests, but sometimes I worry if I'll be able to achieve my dreams.
As for my relationships, I've been having a great time with my friends. We play together during recess, and that's a lot of fun. But sometimes, we also have disagreements, like all friends do. It's important to talk it out and make up.
